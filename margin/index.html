  <div id="box1">I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
    I knew he must a been about seventeen
    The beat was goin' strong
    Playin' my favorite song
    An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
    Till he was with me, yeah me
    And I could tell it wouldn't be long
    Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'</div>

  <div id="box2">I love rock n'roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
Ow!
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
That don't matter, he said
'Cause it's all the same
Said can I take you home where we can be alone'</div>
