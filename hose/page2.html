  <h1>Teis is my page2</h1>

  <p id="p1" class="odd">Miracles happen
    Miracles happen
    You showed me faith is not blind
    I don't need wings to help me fly
    Miracles happen
    Miracles happen</p>

  <p id="p2" class="even">I can't imagine living my life without you now
    Not ever having you around
    We found our way out
    (On you I can depend)
    Don't have to look back to realize how far we've come
    There are a million reasons
    I'm lookin up
    I don't want this to end</p>

<P id="p3" class="odd">Nothing
  Nothing should ever bring you down
  Knowing
  What goes around will come around
  You showed me faith is not blind
  I don't need wings to help me fly
  Miracles happen
  Once in a while
  When you believe
  (Miracles happen)
  You showed me dreams come to life
  And taking a chance on us was right
  All things will come
  With a little time
  When you believe</P>

  <p id="p4" class="even">There is no question
    We found the missing pieces
    Our picture is completed
    It's fallin in to play
    (It's fallin in to play)
    This is a moment
    You are tied and I'm looking out
    Somebody's watching over us
    Keeping me closed
    Closer to you everyday
    Nowhere
    Nowhere on earth I'd rather be
    No one
    Can take this away from you and me</p>
