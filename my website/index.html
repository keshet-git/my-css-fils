  <h1>Teis is my website</h1>

  <p >I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
    I knew he must a been about seventeen
    The beat was goin' strong
    Playin' my favorite song
    An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
    Till he was with me, yeah me
    And I could tell it wouldn't be long
    Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'</p>

  <p>I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
Ow!
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
That don't matter, he said
'Cause it's all the same
Said can I take you home where we can be alone
An' next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me, singin'</p>
